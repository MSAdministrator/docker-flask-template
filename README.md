# Basic Docker Flask Template

This project is a basic `Docker` (and `docker-compose`) Flask project that can be used as a base template.

This project has the following features:

* Bootstrap 4 frontend
* A single container hosting a Flask application
* Utilizes best practices including:
    * Flask application context
    * Flask logging and error handling
    * Flask Blueprints
    * Utilizes a base template inherited within all blueprints
    * Plus more!

> NOTE: This is docker-compose project with only one container

### Prerequisites

To use this project you must download Docker and docker-compose on your local system. You can find more information about how to do that [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing

To get started you must first clone this repository to your local system.

```
git clone https://github.com/MSAdministrator/docker-flask-template.git
cd docker-flask-template
```

Once you have your repository on your system then you can run the following to rebuild and setup your containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans
```

### Structure

All sections of the website should be segmented into blueprints. Each `blueprint` should have the following structure:

```
ðŸ“¦home
 â”£ ðŸ“‚templates
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚home
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œthanks.html
 â”£ ðŸ“œ__init__.py
 â”£ ðŸ“œforms.py
 â”— ðŸ“œviews.py
```

Not all modules (single .py files) may be needed. For example not every blueprint will have a `forms.py` or a `models.py` but each blueprint should have a `__init__.py`, a `views.py`, and a `template/{blueprint_name}` folder structure.

## Deployment

Currently there is `NO` production deployment docker-compose file.
